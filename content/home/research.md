My work has focused on predicting patient outcomes in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). When designing my deep learning models, I am often inspired by my knowledge of clinical decision making.

For example, for time series processing in Electronic Health Records (EHRs), I use temporal and pointwise convolution to efficiently extract patient trajectories over time – a method inspired by clinicians.

I am also working on using graph neural networks to link the experiences of similar patients. The rationale is that when clinicians make decisions they will typically lean on their past experience, especially if they are dealing with a rare disease.
