Until now my work has focused on predicting patient outcomes in the intensive care unit. I design deep learning models in a way that takes advantage of the clinical approach to decision making.

I have recently worked on processing time series in Electronic Health Records. I use temporal convolution and pointwise convolution to do this.

I am currently working on patient graphs, where the nodes are patients and the edges are similarity links. The rationale is that when clinicians make decisions they will lean on their past experience of treating similar patients.
