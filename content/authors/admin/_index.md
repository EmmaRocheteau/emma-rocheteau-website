I have recently graduated with a PhD from the University of Cambridge, where I worked on machine learning problems for healthcare as part of the AI group in the computer science department. I am also a final year medical student and I will become an (academic) foundation doctor in West Suffolk and Addenbrooke's Hospitals from August 2023.

I have previously intercalated in part IIA engineering.
