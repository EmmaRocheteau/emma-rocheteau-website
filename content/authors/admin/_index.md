I am an MB/PhD student at the University of Cambridge working on machine learning problems for healthcare. During my PhD (2017-2021) I was part of the AI group in the computer science and technology department. I am now a final year medical student and I will become an (academic) foundation doctor in West Suffolk and Addenbrooke's Hospitals from next year.

I have previously intercalated in part IIA engineering.
