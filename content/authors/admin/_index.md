I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge working on machine learning problems for healthcare, supervised by Pietro Li√≤. I am part of the AI group in the computer science and technology department, but I am originally from a medical background (my medical studies are paused between the 4th and 5th clinical years to allow me to complete this PhD).

I have previously completed parts IA and IB (years 1 and 2) of the pre-clinical medical and veterinary sciences tripos, part IIA (intercalation year) of the engineering tripos and one year of clinical medicine (on the wards in the hospital setting).
