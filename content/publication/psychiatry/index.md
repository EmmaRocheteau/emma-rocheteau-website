abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) to improve efficiency and personalisation of mental health services. So far, the progress has been slow, however, advancements in deep learning may change this. This paper discusses the role for AI in psychiatry, in particular (a) diagnosis tools, (b) monitoring of symptoms, and (c) delivering personalised treatment recommendations. Finally, I discuss ethical concerns and technological limitations.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
