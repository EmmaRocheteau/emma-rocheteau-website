abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented strain on intensive care unit (ICU) admission
in parts of the world. Strategies to create surge ICU capacity require complex local and national
service reconfiguration and reduction or cancellation of elective activity. These measures have
an inevitable lag-time before additional capacity comes on-line. An accurate short-range forecast
would be helpful in guiding such dicult, costly, and ethically challenging decisions.
At the time this work began, cases in England were starting to increase. If this represents a
true spread in disease then ICU demand could increase rapidly. Here we present a short-range
forecast based on published real-time COVID-19 case data from the seven National Health Service
(NHS) commissioning regions in England (East of England, London, Midlands, North East and
Yorkshire, North West, South East and South West). We use a Monte Carlo approach to model
the likely impact of current diagnoses on regional ICU capacity over a 14-day horizon under the
assumption that the increase in cases represents the start of an exponential growth in infections.
Our model is designed to be parsimonious and based on available epidemiological data from the
literature at the moment.
On the basis of the modelling assumptions made, ICU occupancy is likely to increase dramatically
in the days following the time of modelling. If the current exponential growth continues, case
numbers will be comparable to current ICU bed numbers within weeks. Despite variable growth
in absolute patients, all commissioning regions are forecast to be heavily burdened under the
assumptions used.
Whilst, like any forecast model, there remain uncertainties both in terms of model specification
and robust epidemiological data in this early prospective phase, it would seem that surge capacity
will be required in the very near future. Our findings should be interpreted with caution, but we
hope that our model will help policy decision makers with their preparations. The uncertainties
in the data highlight the urgent need for ongoing real-time surveillance to allow forecasts to be
constantly updated using high quality local patient-facing data as it emerges.
